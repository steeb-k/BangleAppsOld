# Gnome Clock

A Gnome-inspired minimal clockface. Using `widget-utils`, widgets are hidden and can be seen by swiping down on the clock face.

Dark and light-mode wallpapers based on the `drool` wallpaer from [the gnome-wallpapers git](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-backgrounds).

The font is based on the [Cantarell typeface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantarell_%28typeface%29).
